# PINIT

A small python utility that automates the annoying process of creating python package.

What it does:

- Creates auto-filled `setup.py`
- Creates basic `README.md`
- Creates `<your_project_name>` and `tests` folders with their `__init__.py`

## Usage

1. Download this repository
2. Make symlink in your bin directory pointing to `pinit/__main__.py`
3. Create new directory for your project
4. In that directory call `pinit` and follow instructions, they are pretty straight forward, I think.
